This lesson will teach you some simple ways to distinguish between two groups using confidence intervals and t-tests. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to define these terms and use formulas to calculate significant differences between groups.

`@script`
Imagine we have the following data set, which lists actual sales for each of the last 19 days. An analyst on our team also created two sets of predictions using a number of different assumptions (such as whether the economy was improving, if it was sunny outside, etc.). We compared each prediction to the actual value on that day, and we want to determine which set of predictions is more accurate, by comparing to our actual sales data.

## Confidence Intervals (CI)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b441ad0dc3"
```

`@part1`
- Ranges of values that contain the true value X% of the time {{1}}
    - Example: 95% CI contains the true value 95 of 100 data collections
- Used to determine how accurate predictions are {{2}}


`@script`
Confidence intervals can help us do just that. They can assess the accuracy of our predictions by estimating the amount of error in the data.
