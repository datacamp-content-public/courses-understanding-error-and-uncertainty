This lesson will teach you some simple ways to distinguish between two groups using confidence intervals and t-tests. By the end of this chapter, you should be able to define these terms and use formulas to calculate significant differences between groups.

`@script`
Imagine we have the following data set, which lists actual sales for each of the last 19 days. An analyst on our team also created two sets of predictions using a number of different assumptions (such as whether the economy was improving, if it was sunny outside, etc.). We compared each prediction to the actual value on that day, and we want to determine which set of predictions is more accurate, by comparing to our actual sales data.

## Confidence Intervals (CI)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b441ad0dc3"
```

`@part1`
- Ranges of values that contain the true parameter X% of the time {{1}}
    - Example: 95% CI contains the true value 95 of 100 data collections
- Function of three factors {{2}}
    - alpha (confidence level) {{3}}
    - variation in the data (standard deviation) {{4}}
    - number of data points {{5}}


`@script`
Confidence intervals, or CI for short, can help us do just that. They can assess the accuracy of our predictions by estimating the amount of error in the data. 

Confidence intervals are ranges of values that contain the true parameter a certain percentage of the time. When calculating CIs, we specify how much certainty we expect to have. For example, if we collect data 100 different times, a 95% confidence interval will contain the true value 95 of those times.

CIs vary based on three factors: 1) the alpha, or confidence level; 2) the variance of the data, as measured by the standard deviation--or average distance from the average; and 3) the number of observations the data set contains. 

The higher the confidence level, the larger the interval. This should make intuitive sense. A larger range (or interval), gives us more confidence that a given value will fall within it. A typical alpha level is 0.05 for 95% confidence. 

The variation also impacts the size of the confidence interval. Data with more variation requires a larger confidence interval, as we grow less certain that our sample represents all the variation in the true data. 

Finally, a higher number of observations decreases the size of the confidence interval because more data points give us greater predictive power and confidence.

## CI Calculations

```yaml
type: "TwoColumns"
key: "02c00250e9"
```

`@part1`
- n = `19` {{1}}
    - `-=COUNT(A2:A20)`{{1}}
- mean = `40` {{2}}
   - `=AVERAGE(A2:A20)` {{2}}
- alpha = `0.05` {{3}}
- standard deviation = `28.35` {{4}}
    - `=STDEV(A2:A20)` {{4}}

`@script`
Now let's calculate confidence intervals. Recall that our data set had 19 observations and a mean of 40. Let's set alpha equal to 0.05 for a 95% confidence level. We can use the STDEV formula to calculate the standard deviation of the data as approximately 28.35.

## CI Calculations

```yaml

```

`@part1`
- confidence interval: `=CONFIDENCE(0.05, STDEV(A2:A20), COUNT(A2:A20))` 
- â‰ˆ `12.75` {{1}}

`@script`
We can put this all together to calculate the confidence interval. Our formula returns a result of approximately 12.75. But how should we use this information?

## Know Your Bounds

`@script`
We typically refer to confidence intervals by their upper and lower bounds around the mean. Let's practice calculating these. Let's say we want to calculate the upper and lower bounds of a 95% confidence interval for the average sales over the last 19 days.
