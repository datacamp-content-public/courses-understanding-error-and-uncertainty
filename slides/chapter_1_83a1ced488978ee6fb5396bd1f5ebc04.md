## Confidence Intervals (CI)

```yaml
type: "FullSlide"
key: "b441ad0dc3"
```

`@part1`
- Ranges of values that contain the true value X% of the time {{1}}
    - Example: 95% CI contains the true value 95 of 100 data collections
- Used to determine how accurate predictions are {{2}}


`@script`
Confidence intervals help us assess the accuracy of our predictions. Imagine we have the following data set.
